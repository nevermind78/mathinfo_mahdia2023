    "Throughout this text we have often used the word *function* to refer to mathematical formulae like that of a line, a quadratic, a logistic sigmoid, etc. Such formulae are often called *mathematical functions* as well, hence our use of the phrase 'function' to refer to them.  However the word 'function' is a much more general term, and broadly encompasses any rule or set of rules for assigning or transforming some kind of 'input' into some kind of 'output'.  For example a recipe for chocolate cake is an example of a function, that is a set of rules for how to take certain inputs - like eggs, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, etc., - and transform them into an 'output' chocolate cake.

    "We have also seen a variety of algorithmic functions in prior Chapters.  For example *gradient descent* which (see Section 3.5) is an algorithmic function that takes in various inputs - a mathematical function to minimize, an initial point, a steplength, and a maximum number of steps to take - and returns certain outputs (e.g., a history of descent steps).  The process of building a Bag of Words histogram - as detailed at a high level in Section 9.1 - is another an example of an algorithmic function.  Here the input, raw text, is transformed into a numerical histogram representing counts of the words the input contains.  Such a function is much more easily detailed programatically, in code, than it is mathematically, using formulae. "

    "Data is the third sort of function we deal with regularly - each instance of which we refer to as an *emprical function*.  The generic set of supervised learning data which we often denote by $\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_p,y_p\\right\\}_{p=1}^P$ always defines a trivial rule for assigning input to output: pairing.  The input $\\mathbf{x}_p$ is simply paired with its output $y_p$.  This perahps can be more easily see by listing off each data pair in a table, as shown below. "
